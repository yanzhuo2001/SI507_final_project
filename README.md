1. Run Yelp.py to get the json file ann_arbor_restaurants.json
2. Run app.py to start the local user and get a web page, then you can perform the action of search and filter.

Ps1: plot_graph.py is used to generate an overview of price, ranges, ratings and categories of all restaurants in Ann Arbor.
Ps2: all_xxx.py is used to see all kinds of categories, transactions, review counts of all restaurants in Ann Arbor and save the result in xxx.txt file. Then I can use the results to design the filter forms in web page. You don't need to run them to perform action of search and filter.
