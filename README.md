# SI507_final_project
The final project of course SI 507
# Aim of this project
Able to search, filter, and see details of all restaurants in Ann Arbor, and show the real-time results and links on a map in a html file.
# How to use the code
First run the file Yelp.py and get the file ann_arbor_restaurants.json
Then run the file plot_graph.py to see the overall view of all restaurants in Ann Arbor.
Finally run the file convert_json_map.py and follow the instructions to search or filter restaurants in Ann Arbor. Also you will get a html file, by clicking on it you can see the result of every operation you made in the command line.
The all_categories.py and all_transactions.py is used to generate all_categories.txt and all_transactions.txt, and I can see the all categories and transaction types. You can run them but you will not need to use them.
